I’m a technologist who loves studying, building, and talking about all things tech. I started building applications 20+ years ago when vbscript was more widely used than javascript. Over the years I have worked with various technologies including Dot.Net, Oracle, SQL Server, Java, Hibernate, Spring, C, Hadoop, Spark, Scala, Kubernetes, ZIO, Cats, and many more.

  

Ultimately, my passion lies in building tech, taking requirements or ideas, and morphing them into "tangible" tech.

  

I am a big advocate of knowledge transfer so you'll find me now and then sharing my 5 cents.

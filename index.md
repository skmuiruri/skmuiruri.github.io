My name is Kamau and i love programming - turning business logic to runnable code that's maintainable, easy to scale and safe - but i also just love coding.

I love exploring different programming topics including (but not limited to) scala, functional programming, and distributed programming. 
I've been studying this topics for a while but never really documented anything. This blog is meant document my exploratory journey as i dive dipper into topics both common and not so common.

Feel free to dop me a line with any suggestions, recommendations or critics.

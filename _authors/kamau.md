I love programming turning business logic to runnable code that's maintainable, easy to scale and safe - but i also just love coding.I love exploring different programming topics including (but not limited to) scala, functional programming, and distributed programming.I've been studying these topics for a while but never really documented anything. This blog is meant document my exploratory journey as i dive dipper into topics both common and not so common.
